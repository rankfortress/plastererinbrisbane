	We don’t beat around the bush when it comes to looking after our customers plastering, gyprock and cornice installation needs. From walls to ceilings we’ve got you covered at a cost that won’t burn your bank notes.Historically, plaster and lath walls were an essential part of building construction. Nowadays however, they are only used by specialists due to the rise in popularity for gyprock products that were developed during the early 20th century. Let’s take a look at some benefits of using these materials over traditional methods like plasterboard or drywall.
	
	When renovating an old property, you may find lath and plaster walls. These are made of horizontal strips of wood (lath) layered with layers of plaster. Laths and plasters have been used for hundreds if not thousands of years across the world without many changes in design- they’re often chosen for sensitive restoration work due to their timelessness.
